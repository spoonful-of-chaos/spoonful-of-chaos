The goal of the encounter generator is to provide balanced encounters within the world of The Last of Us. I would like to update this in the future to include more general monsters, but for now, we're running with just the Last of Us custom campaign setting. The calculations used for this generator are based on the simple models outlined in DragnaCarta's [Challenge Ratings 2.0](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-N4m46K77hpMVnh7upYa), which I've personally found to be a better gauge of difficulty for my party.
