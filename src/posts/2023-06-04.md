Smugglers, Survivors, Preppers, Soldiers, and Bandits, oh my! I've finally got up the different character classes. 

- [Smuggler](/spoonful-of-chaos/lou5e/classes/smuggler): A charismatic fighter with a few tricks up their sleeves. Influenced by bard and monk classes.
- [Survivor](/spoonful-of-chaos/lou5e/classes/survivor): A master of survival within and outside of quarantine zones. Mostly a ranger with a few sorcerous tweaks.
- [Prepper](/spoonful-of-chaos/lou5e/classes/prepper): A long-term planner with an arsenal of traps, tricks, and other craftables. Think the wizard of the zombie apocalypse. 
- [Soldier](/spoonful-of-chaos/lou5e/classes/soldier): A combat specialist trained in a variety of abilities. Barbarian + fighter - the tank.
- [Bandit](/spoonful-of-chaos/lou5e/classes/bandit): A quick and quiet rogue who uses stealth and skill to solve problems. Almost entirely rogue with some splashes of fun stuff thrown in.
