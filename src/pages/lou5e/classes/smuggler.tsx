          Smiling, a man in dusty clothes reaches out his hand to another, the palmed package of pills exchanged for ration cards with nothing more than a handshake.
          <br /><br />
          A woman crouches and listens carefully around the corner of the broken down office building. Moving silently, she approaches the clicker from behind, stabbing it through the neck before it can scream.
        </p>
        <p>
          The young man breathes in and exhales slowly before pulling the trigger on the rifle braced against his shoulder. The runner chasing his partner collapses on the ground.
        </p>
